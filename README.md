# CipherVault-Generating Fortified Password
# Introduction
This Python-based password generator project offers a robust solution for creating strong, customizable passwords using advanced encryption techniques. The generated passwords are securely encrypted using AES encryption and encoded using Base64, ensuring their integrity and confidentiality.
# Features
1)Customizable Password Length: Users can specify the length of the generated password to meet various security requirements.\
2)Secure Encryption: Passwords are encrypted using the AES encryption algorithm, making them unreadable to unauthorized users.\
3)Base64 Encoding: Encrypted passwords are encoded using Base64, allowing for safe storage and transmission.\
4)User-Friendly Interface: The project provides a clean and intuitive graphical interface for easy password generation, encryption, and decryption.\
5)Export Functionality: Users can export both encrypted and decrypted passwords to text files for safekeeping or sharing.
